				<h1>About Me</h1>
				<p>Hi! My name is Angela (Angie for short), and I go by firubii online. I'm a 24 year old transgender girl and lesbian with partially-diagnosed autism who loves video games and programming. I've worked with C# for most of my life, but have messed with C, C++, Lua a lot and Java, Python a few times. I have an interest in software and video game development, and know enough to make a game myself, though my artistic skills are lacking. I have a small passion for drawing, music, and singing, though I don't really do much with that as of late. My programming, art, and music skills are mostly self-taught, so I'm always trying to improve or find better methods of doing things.</p>
				<p>I'm super into Kirby, Touhou Project, Umamusume, and fighting games and Nintendo in general.</p>
				<p>I LOVE space aesthetics, and also blue, pink, and purple, if you couldn't tell already from the site.</p>
				<p>If you want to contact me for whatever reason, please see the <a href="../">index</a> page for social media methods.<br>My Twitter and Tumblr DMs are always open, but if you prefer the use of Discord, <b>please don't randomly send me a friend request, I don't tend to accept ones from people I don't already know</b>. Discord has message requests now for a reason.</p>
