				<h1>About Me</h1>
				<p>Hi! My name is Angela (Angie for short), and I go by firubii online. I'm a 20 year old transgender girl and lesbian with (probably) ADHD who loves video games and programming. I've worked with C# for most of my life, but have messed with Java, Lua, and Python a few times. I have an interest in software and video game development, and know how to use Unity enough to make a game myself, though my artistic skills are lacking. I have a small passion for drawing, music, and singing, though I don't really do much with that as of late. My programming, art, and music skills are mostly self-taught, so I'm always trying to improve or find better methods of doing things.</p>
				<p>I really, REALLY like the Kirby and Touhou Project series of video games.<br>I can and will info dump about those forever if given the chance.<br>Though, despite that, my favorite game of all time is Super Mario Galaxy.</p>
				<p>I LOVE space aesthetics, and also blue, pink, and purple, if you couldn't tell already from the site.</p>
				<p>If you want to contact me for whatever reason, please see the <a href="../">index</a> page for social media methods.<br>My Twitter DMs are always open, just please don't be weird or only send something like "Hi".<br>If you prefer the use of Discord, <b>please don't randomly send me a friend request</b>. Join a server I'm in (my <a href="https://discord.gg/bWTDt6H">KSA Modding Server</a> is fine) and send me a DM.</p>
